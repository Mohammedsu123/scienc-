<h2>Ahmed Zewail</h2> <img  class = "ChangeColor" src="images/asd1.JPG" width="150px;"  >
<p>Ahmed Hassan Zewail  was an Egyptian-American scientist, known as the "father of femtochemistry".[3] He was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry and became the first Egyptian and the first Arab to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field. He was the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.

<h2>Albert Einstein</h2> <img src="images/asd3.jpg" width="150px;"  >
<p>  Albert Einstein 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physicsEinstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "services to theoretical physics", in particular his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.             </p>

<h2>Isaac Newton</h2> <img src="images/asd4.jpg" width="150px;"  >
<p> Sir Isaac Newton, English scientist is one of the most prominent scholars contribution to physics and mathematics through the ages and a scientific revolution icons. Newton held the post of president of the Royal Society, and was a member of the English Parliament, in addition to assuming the presidency of the Royal Mint, and his fellowship to Trinity College in Cambridge, the second Ocazi professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. The foundations of his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published for the first time in 1687, for most of the principles of classical mechanics. Newton also made significant contributions in the field of optics, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz participated in laying the foundations of calculus.

<h2>  John Dalton </h2> <img src="images/asd5.jpg" width="150px;"  >
<p> John Dalton was born into a Quaker family at the settlement of Eaglesfield, near the town of Cockermouth, in the county of Cumberland, England in 1766.[1] His father was a weaver. He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher, who ran a private school at Pardshaw Hall. With his family too poor to support him for long, he began to earn his living at the age of ten in the service of a wealthy local Quaker, Elihu Robinson.[2][3] It is said he began teaching at a local school at age 12, and was proficient in Latin at age 14. </p>

<h2> Robert A. Millikan</h2> <img src="images/asd7.jpg" width="150px;"  >
<p> The oil drop experiment was performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 to measure the elementary electric charge (the charge of the electron).

The experiment entailed observing tiny charged droplets of oil between two horizontal metal electrodes. First, with zero applied electric field, the terminal velocity of a droplet was measured. At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the gravitational force, and these depend on the radius in different ways, so that the radius of the droplet, and therefore the mass and gravitational force, could be determined (using the known density of the oil).             </p>

<h2>  Ernest Rutherford </h2> <img src="images/asd8.jpg" width="150px;"  >
<p> Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, was a New Zealand physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. Encyclopædia Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday 
In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, proved that radioactivity involved the nuclear transmutation of one chemical element to another, and also differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation.[3] This work was done at McGill University in Canada. It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances",[4] for which he is the first Canadian and Oceanian Nobel laureate, and remains the only laureate born in the South Island. </p>
